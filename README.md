# FLtoCL
Syncs logging data from FLDigi via the XMLRPC interface and sends QSOs to CloudLog

Currently this repo is just me playing around with the 3 APIs involved--fldigi's XMLRPC interface, HamQTH for callbook information, and CloudLog's APIs to add an ADIF record to the log.

# FLDigi now supports CloudLog as a native logging target so this is no longer needed.  I'm leaving this here as an example of some python to interact with the APIs.
