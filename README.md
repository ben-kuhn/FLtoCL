# FLtoCL
Syncs logging data from FLDigi via the XMLRPC interface and sends QSOs to CloudLog

Currently this repo is just me playing around with the 3 APIs involved--fldigi's XMLRPC interface, HamQTH for callbook information, and CloudLog's APIs to add an ADIF record to the log.

Right now I really have no idea what I'm doing since my programming experience is primarly C/C++ for Arduinos, etc...  I need to learn Python better and what better way to do that than to make something useful.  Please feel free to contribute but be nice when my code is trash.
